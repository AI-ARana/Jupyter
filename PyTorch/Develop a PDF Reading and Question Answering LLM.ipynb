      "Procedure: In Fig. 3, 20 neurons are spread throughout the first and second hidden levels of a 4-layer neural\n",
      "network (Hl1and Hl2 respectively). The input layer receives the slowness parameter and the output layer\n",
      "generates the desired output using a single neuron. Since the sigmoid activation function is non-linear and\n",
      "differentiable, it is employed by the neurons in input & hidden layers. However, the linear activation function\n",
      "used at the output layer. Output error, as measured by mean square error (MSE), reduces with training\n",
      "iterations as shown in Fig. 7. Output error quickly decreases for the first thirty (30) iterations, going through\n",
      "2 or 3 local minima as seen in the inset of Fig. 7. After around 150 iterations, the rate of gain in ANN\n",
      "performance slows to a plateau, with further iterations providing little to no benefit. This curve is shown in\n",
      "greater detail for the first iteration in the inset.\n",
      "RESULT AND DISCUSSION\n",
      "Epicentral Distance Estimation:\n",
      "The trained ANN receives slowness values from this dataset at its input layer and produces an estimate of\n",
      "slowness at its output layer as computed Δ is output of network. The suggested ANN-based approach is\n",
      "compared to a polynomial fitting approach by first fitting polynomials of varied degrees to the test dataset in\n",
      "a least-squares manner. It is shown that the fit does not better for orders higher than seven as the polynomial\n",
      "order is increased from one to seven. The desired and calculated Δ value difference is called absolute error.\n",
      "Figure 8 compares the computed and desired Δ as a function of slowness using ANN and polynomial fit for\n",
      "whole dataset in the Appendix 1. As can be observed, training and testing events Δ computed (in red) closely\n",
      "tracks by ANN desired Δ (in blue) within an error of roughly ±1º, but the polynomial fit technique (in solid\n",

      "source parameters in addition to spectral parameters acquired from velocity & acceleration records at\n",
      "numerous places. It has been determined that the moment magnitude for this event was 4.7 ± 0.09 at several\n",
      "locations, and the seismic moment was in order of (107 ± 0.19) × 1023 (dyne.cm). A stress reduction of 76.3\n",
      "± 11.5 (bars) and a source-radius of (850.0 ± 38.0) (m) are determined. The maximum frequency of this\n",
      "earthquake was measured to be 9.1 ± 1.7 (Hz) using data collected from a wide range of stations in a variety\n",
      "of geological settings. Some short period instruments show a shift in the spectral fall-off above fmax, while\n",
      "strong motion instruments maintain a constant value.\n",

      "Earthquake Prediction:\n",
      "For more precise forecasts, it is common practise to input training data to an expert system; in this example,\n",
      "forty earthquakes are used as training data, while the rest of used as testing and validation data. The validation\n",
      "and testing data is useful for verifying the modelled ANFIS's performance [26]. Obtaining the magnitude of\n",
      "an earthquake in the future or even in the past is possible by considering the three most relevant variables.\n",
      "The magnitude of the earthquake is desired outcome, and the three assumed input variables are the epicentre\n",
      "distance, year of occurrence, and the earthquake’s peak ground acceleration. This part of the process ensures\n",
      "that the ANFIS model is accurate, efficient, and capable of saving time. It explains how to use triangular\n",
      "membership functions in the event of grid portioning and compares the outcomes to those obtained using the\n",
      "subtractive clustering method. The output is determined by a membership function of a triangular kind, with\n",
      "5 and 7 neurons, respectively. Data for training evaluation has improved from Fig. 11 (a) to (c) as a result of\n",
      "increasing the number of neurons from three to five (b). While these models perform well in the training\n",
      "data, they forecast earthquakes of an unsatisfactory size in the testing data, which is unacceptable if we want\n",
      "to improve the quality of our predictions. The testing data set comparing observed and forecasted earthquake\n",
      "magnitudes is depicted in Figures 12(a) and (b). When employing subtractive clustering, the user is not given\n",
      "the option to select the membership function used in the process. This study's data set was well predicted by\n",
      "subtractive clustering even without the use of any normalising approach. Subtractive clustering was found to\n",
      "be the most effective predictor of the desired outcome in this investigation. The ANFIS method predicted\n",
      "pretty accurately as the residuals were distributed uniformly near to the centrelines. Predicted and observed\n",
      "earthquake magnitudes versus sample size are shown in Figures 13 and 14, respectively.\n",

      "CONCLUSION:\n",
      "ANFIS for determining earthquake magnitude can be game-changing. ANFIS can learn like a person using\n",
      "only the data that has already been collected, resulting in more accurate forecasts without the need for\n",
      "elaborate machinery. In order to create the FIS for this investigation, a computer running Python 3x on a core\n",
      "i5 11th generation with NVIDIA GEFORCE RTX 3050ti GPU processor is employed. The study also shows\n",
      "that it is not always preferable to assume a high membership function input count in order to obtain a desired\n",
      "outcome. Different data arrangements can have a significant impact on the quality of the conclusion that can\n",
      "be drawn. The magnitude of earthquakes can be predicted with high accuracy using subtractive clustering,\n",
      "which does not require any sort of normalisation. Therefore, this study has the potential to contribute in the\n",
      "forecasting of earthquakes of a magnitude larger than 5. While this research cannot provide definitive\n",
      "solutions, it may provide practitioners a direction to go in.\n",
